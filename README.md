Hellow,
I performed the task the we dissuced on.
we created a factory that is responsible for the creation of two type of classes, NormalClass and Singleton.
The creation is posible from swagger in 3 ways, by calling spesific function for each or by sending a String as described in the description.
Observer desighn pattern were used to notify about the changes of the messages, where for the normal class i also added an ID so that we can verify the change was done.

Swagger may be accsed from default url : http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html

Thank you, Hoppefuly we will speak again.
